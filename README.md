# Netflix-

I developed a responsive Netflix-themed webpage using HTML,CSS and JS.

## Features

- **HTML5**: Utilized semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Used Flexbox and Grid for modern, flexible layouts. Applied custom CSS variables for consistent styling.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries.
- **Modern UI**: Designed a visually appealing interface inspired by Netflix, including navigation bar, hero section, and movie cards.
